# Aliena: A Third-Person Rhino Adventure!

Welcome to Aliena! This Unity project was my exam when taking my Unity Course. It is a group project where i collaborated with 3 other students and this is what we ended up with :) 

# The Story:

Your adventure begins aboard a spaceship. As you navigate, you discover a mysterious portal. Stepping through, you find yourself transported to a lush jungle island teeming with... rhinos!

* Exploration and Photography:

  * Explore the vibrant island environment from a third-person perspective. Keep your eyes peeled for the magnificent rhinos, and don't forget to capture stunning photos of these majestic creatures!

* Beware the Charge!

  * While exploring, be mindful of the rhinos. Get too close, and they'll charge! But fear not, scattered throughout the island are glowing orbs. Collect these orbs to recharge your energy after a rhino encounter.

* The Path to Escape:

  * As you collect all the orbs, a portal will reappear, offering your escape route back to the main menu.

# This project includes:

* Third-person character controls
* Exploration of a beautiful jungle island
* Interactions with rhinos - both peaceful and aggressive
* Photography mechanic to capture rhino memories
* Orb collection for energy restoration
* Portal system for entering and exiting the island
